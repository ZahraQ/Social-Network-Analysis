# Social-Network-Analysis
Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a core aspect of analyzing social networks today. In addition to the usual statistical techniques for data analysis, these networks are investigated using SNA measures. It helps in understanding the dependencies between social entities in the data, characterizing their behaviors and their effect on the network as a whole and over time.[1]
