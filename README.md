# Social-Network-Analysis
Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a core aspect of analyzing social networks today. In addition to the usual statistical techniques for data analysis, these networks are investigated using SNA measures. It helps in understanding the dependencies between social entities in the data, characterizing their behaviors and their effect on the network as a whole and over time.[1]

You can download the Database from the following link: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

In the “Social Network Analysis with Python” notebook, we use the Enron Database. This dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, organized into folders. The corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. This data was originally made public, and posted to the web, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation.

The Jupyter notebook is organized as below:

1.	Preparing Data
2.	Creating the network
3.	Analyzing the network

The Original Enron Dataset contains a set of folders that organizes a collection of mailboxes by person and folder. Data wrangling is a routine problem, and this section should give you some perspective and some appreciation for it.

Understanding and Simulating Dynamics on the Network using PyCX

The PyCX project aims to develop an online repository of simple, crude, yet easy-to-understand Python sample codes for dynamic complex systems modeling and simulation, including iterative maps, network analysis, dynamical networks, etc.

To use “pycxsimulator.py”, we need to place that file in the directory where the file code is located.

To understand dynamics on networks, we will use the “pycxsimulator.py” file and implement a simple majority rule on the Karate club graph, also the two most used contagion models: SIS (Susceptible- Infected- Susceptible) model and SIS Adaptive model.
To execute these files, we will use the Spyder IDE.
